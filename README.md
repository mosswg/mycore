# mycore
mycore is an assembly library for x86 NASM. It is intended mostly for my use but anyone is welcome to use or modify it however they like. mycore originated as the std library for a language I'm working on however I quickly realized making a complex programming language in asm was not ideal. So, now it's repurposed as a library for assembly.

## How to use
include the `std` folder in your project directory and include files with the `%include` macro.
